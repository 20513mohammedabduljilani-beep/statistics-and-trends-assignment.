**Module:** Applied Data Science 1 – Statistics and Trends  
**Instructor:** William Cooper  



## Overview
This project analyses **Global Unemployment Trends** between **2014 and 2024**, focusing on key countries:  
**United States, India, China, and Brazil**.

The analysis was completed using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**, following the module notes on:
- *Introduction and Relational Graphs*  
- *Reading Files and Categorical Graphs*  
- *Basic Statistics and Statistical Graphs*  
- *Distributions and Good Coding Practice*
- *Version Control and Further Graphs*



## Contents
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `global_unemployment_analysis.ipynb` | Main Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis and plots |
| `global_unemployment_analysis.py` | Python script exported from the notebook for submission |
| `global_unemployment.csv` | Dataset from Kaggle (“Global Unemployment Data”) |
| `README.md` | Project overview file (this document) |



## Graphs Produced
1. **Line Plot** – Global Unemployment Trends (2014–2024)  
   Shows unemployment rate changes for the four countries over time.  

2. **Histogram** – Distribution of Unemployment Rates  
   Displays the frequency of unemployment rate values for all countries.  

3. **Box Plot** – Comparison of Unemployment Rate Distributions  
   Shows relationships between unemployment rates across different years.



## Statistics Used
The project calculates the **four main statistical moments**:
- Mean  
- Variance  
- Skewness  
- Kurtosis  

These are used to describe the shape and spread of unemployment rate distributions.



## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** and the following libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install seaborn

## Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

**Version Control**: Code maintained and committed using Git and GitHub.

**Data Preparation**: Dataset cleaned and structured using pandas.

**Statistical Analysis**: Key summary statistics and visualisations produced.

**Communication**: Findings clearly presented through plots and report.
